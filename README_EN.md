# 🌈 Grey-Box Visualization Framework v2.0  
### *A general six-layer interpretability framework for LLM decision-flow & structured semantic analysis*  
*(Inspired by SAIIP, but fully domain-agnostic)*

---

## 🔹 Summary

**The Grey-Box Visualization Framework v2.0** is a universal, six-layer conceptual interpretability model designed to visualize how **any large language model (LLM)** processes:

- semantic structure  
- attention distribution  
- reasoning pathways  
- importance weighting  
- flow acceleration  
- decision-altering interventions  

Although the framework was originally inspired by analyzing the poetic language system **SAIIP（嵐印語）**,  
its six-layer design is **fully general-purpose** and applicable to:

- moral reasoning (e.g., the Trolley Problem)  
- LLM internal decision tendencies  
- explainability education  
- visualization research  
- linguistic / structural analysis  
- conceptual illustration tools  

> **No knowledge of SAIIP is required to use or understand this framework.**  
> SAIIP is included only as an optional example of an extended application.

# Executive Summary

The **Grey-Box Visualization Framework v2.0** introduces a structured and intuitive system for interpreting LLM behavior through a six-layer conceptual model:

1. Semantic Nodes  
2. Attention Mapping  
3. Semantic Flow  
4. Heatmap Weight Layer  
5. Semantic Flow Velocity  
6. Action Intervention Ring  

These layers collectively show **how models shift focus, propagate meaning, assign implicit importance, build decisions, and react to interventions**.

While inspired by observations from SAIIP（嵐印語）, the framework is **fully general** and suited for any reasoning or generative model.

# Purpose & Scope

## ✔ Primary Purposes
- Provide clear, visual interpretability for LLM reasoning  
- Model semantic structure and decision flow  
- Represent weighted or moral-like tendencies  
- Highlight where actions or inputs can change outcomes  
- Serve as a conceptual analysis tool for research & education  

## ✔ Optional Purposes  
*(Not required to use the framework)*  
- Analyze structured or rhythm-based systems such as SAIIP  
- Study semantic–rhythmic alignment  
- Extend to poetic or symbolic generation tasks  

---

# Conceptual Assumptions

The framework assumes general properties of language models:

1. Semantics can be abstracted as **nodes**  
2. Attention can be visualized as **weighted edges**  
3. Meaning transitions appear as **directed flows**  
4. Importance or burden appears as **heat levels**  
5. Reasoning intensity can appear as **flow velocity**  
6. Human or model actions can function as **intervention points**

These assumptions are universal and do not depend on any specific language system.

# Six-Layer Grey-Box Model (v2.0)

## **Layer 1 — Semantic Nodes**  
Concepts, tokens, or contextual units shown as nodes.

## **Layer 2 — Attention Mapping**  
Weighted lines representing attention relationships.

## **Layer 3 — Semantic Flow**  
Arrows indicating meaning propagation or reasoning direction.

## **Layer 4 — Heatmap Weight Layer (NEW)**  
Darker or larger nodes = higher importance/moral/structural weight.

## **Layer 5 — Semantic Flow Velocity (NEW)**  
Thicker or sharper flow lines = faster reasoning acceleration.

## **Layer 6 — Action Intervention Ring (NEW)**  
Halo around agents or nodes capable of altering the decision path.

# Mapping to XAI Concepts

| Framework Layer | XAI Equivalent |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Semantic Nodes | Embeddings / Concept clusters |
| Attention Mapping | Attention visualization |
| Semantic Flow | Saliency / Influence paths |
| Heatmap Weight | Feature importance |
| Flow Velocity | Gradient dynamics |
| Intervention Ring | Causal analysis / Counterfactual reasoning |

---

# Extended Application: Semantic–Rhythmic Alignment Example (Optional)

This section demonstrates how the framework **can also** analyze structured systems where rhythm or cadence interacts with meaning.

SAIIP（嵐印語）is referenced **only as an example**, showing how rhythm-based constraints can be layered into the six-layer visualization.

Users do **not** need to understand SAIIP to use the framework.

---

# Example: Trolley Problem

The six-layer framework makes the Trolley Problem visually interpretable:

- Semantic nodes represent trolley, people, tracks, switch  
- Attention mapping highlights focus points  
- Semantic flow shows branching decisions  
- Heatmap weight visualizes moral pressure  
- Flow velocity indicates rapid commitment  
- Intervention ring marks the agent capable of redirecting the path  

This provides a conceptual view of how models might represent decision-like reasoning.

---

# Limitations

- Conceptual; does not reflect real neuron weights  
- Not a diagnostic or gradient-level tool  
- Heat and velocity layers are illustrative abstractions  
- Action intervention is symbolic, not a true causal operator  

---

# Conclusion

The **Grey-Box Visualization Framework v2.0** is a **universal, domain-independent interpretability framework** suitable for:

- reasoning analysis  
- visualization design  
- education  
- structured explanations of LLM behavior  
- moral or multi-branch decision representation  

It is inspired by, but **not dependent on**, SAIIP（嵐印語）.

You may use this framework with **any** language, dataset, or AI system.
